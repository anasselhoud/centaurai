We develop, implement and deploy **Machine Learning Models** for you


# How?

 **CentaurAI** has a strong knowledge in Machine Learning, advanced statistical analysis which allows us to develop and implement models that predict, classify and fit your data to solve your specific problem.
The goal of machine learning is to build systems capable of finding patterns in data, learning from it without human intervention and explicit reprogramming.

## Models We Use

In **CentaurAI**, we use different ML models such as:

> Linear/Logistic Regression.

> Decision Tree & Random Forest.

> Gaussian Processes

> SVM & Naive Bayes.

> kNN (K-Nearest Neighbours).

> K-means

> PCA & All Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms.

> Bagging and Gradient Boosting

We also use, depending on the project, many deep learning architectures:

> CNN – Convolutional Neural Network

> RNN – Recurrent Neural Network

> LSTM – Long Short Term Memory

> GAN – Generative Adversarial Network
