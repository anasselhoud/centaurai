We develop, implement and deploy **Machine Learning Models** for you


# How?

 **CentaurAI** has a strong knowledge in Machine Learning, advanced statistical analysis which allows us to develop and implement models that predict, classify and fit your data to solve your specific problem.
The goal of machine learning is to build systems capable of finding patterns in data, learning from it without human intervention and explicit reprogramming.

## Models We Use

In **CentaurAI**, we use different ML models such as:

> Linear/Logistic Regression.

> Decision Tree & Random Forest.

> SVM & Naive Bayes.

> kNN (K-Nearest Neighbours).

> K-means

> PCA & All Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms.

> Bagging and Gradient Boosting

We also use, depending on the project, many deep learning architectures:

> CNN – Convolutional Neural Network

> RNN – Recurrent Neural Network

> LSTM – Long Short Term Memory

> GAN – Generative Adversarial Network

Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.

## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

### Verifiability
Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.

### Comparability
Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.

### Understandability
Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.


Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.
